<h3>Evolutionary Computation</h3>
is a subset of evolutionary calculations. The evolutionary algorithm uses some mechanisms inspired by biological evolution: cloning, mutation, resynthesize, and selection. The candidate solutions to the optimal problem play the role of individuals in a segment of the population, the appropriate task determines the environment in which the solutions are made (see also the mathematics of example) population development takes its place after the repeated application of the process above. Artificial evolution describes the individual process involving evolutionary algorithms, Evolutionary algorithms often perform well to find approximate solutions to all kinds of problems because ideally they do not make any assumption about the appropriate task behind the scene, and this generalization is shown from the successes achieved in various fields such as engineering, art, biology, economics, marketing, genetics, research processes, robotics, social sciences physics politics and chemistry.
<h3>neural networks</h3>
We can define neural networks as a mathematical and programmatic attempt to simulate the way the human brain works. Whereas, scientists have almost discovered the way the human brain works in terms of learning ability, portability, the ability to distinguish objects and the ability to make decisions. And the brain, as you know, consists of billions of neurons intertwined with each other in a very complex way through the neurons of each cell, which forms a huge network of neurons linked with each other through these appendages This interconnection between neurons gives it the ability to store information, images, sound and so on from the signals it receives through the five senses, and then also allows them to learn by repetition and error.

It is one of the fields of computer science, aimed at building smart applications that are able to understand the content of images as human beings. Where image data can take many forms, such as successive images (video), scenes from several cameras, data of several dimensions taken from a medical imaging device.
