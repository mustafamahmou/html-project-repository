<h3>history of artificial intelligence</h3>
ïƒ˜	The field of AI research was established within a workshop on the Dartmouth College campus during the summer of 1956. Those who attended would become leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine of human intelligence would not be present in more than a generation, and that they had received millions of dollars to make this vision a reality Before that, the history of artificial intelligence began in ancient times, through myths, stories, and rumors of artificial creatures gifted with intelligence or awareness by skilled craftsmen. The seeds of modern artificial intelligence were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as a mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the digital programmable computer in the 1940s, a machine that draws on the essence of mathematical logical reasoning. This device inspired the ideas behind a handful of scientists to start seriously discussing the possibility of electronic brain and  In this research, we will get to know together his specialties.
